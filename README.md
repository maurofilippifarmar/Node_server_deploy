# API Mini Project

In this repository you will create and work in the afternoon on the mini project
 with the provided topic. 

The idea is that you implement the topics of the teaching material from the morning
in the afternoon self work.

## Instructions

After cloning this repo, periodically push your code. Please make sure that you are
only pushing files that are needed. No `node_modules` and also no environment variables.

This is an individual project, however you may work in a group in order to ask help 
from your peers. Try to make your work unique to you, and avoid copying others code.

You won't be required to present anything, however you can show the results to the class 
if you wish to. 

## Topics 

Please choose one:

- clone of the [json placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
- clone of the [reqres](https://reqres.in/)

With the chosen API read the documentation on how to implement your end point.
It doesn't need to be exactly the same, you may change something to your liking.

Later in the course we will create a front-end React application to display the data 
from the backend. Think ahead of time on how you could build such an application.
